# SimpleLinearRegression
This project practices the use of a Linear Regression model with one feature—SAT scores—to predict students' GPA.

•	libraries
  o	Numpy
  o	Matplotlib
  o	pandas

• What I do in the practice project
  o split dataset into 2 set. The first one is training set data, and the second one is test set data.
  o Use class LinearRegression from sklearn library to train the model.
  o After training the model, use the model to predict students' GPA by using test set data.
  o Then plot graph for Training set and Test set.
  o Use regressiion model predict a single input (SAT score) and print predict output (GPA).
  o Print coefficient and y-intercept of the equation
• The picture below is the graph of Training Set and Test Set
