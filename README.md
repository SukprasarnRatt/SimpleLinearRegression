# Simple Linear Regression Practice

This project practices the use of a Linear Regression model with one feature—SAT scores—to predict students' GPA.

## Libraries

- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- pandas
- sklearn

## Steps in the Practice

1. **Split Dataset**: Split the dataset into two sets - a training set (80%) and a test set (20%).
2. **Train Model**: Use the `LinearRegression` class from the `sklearn` library to train the model using the training set data.
3. **Predict GPA**: After training the model, use it to predict students' GPA by using the test set data.
4. **Plot Graph**: Plot graphs for both the Training set and Test set.
5. **Single Input Prediction**: Use the regression model to predict a single input (SAT score) and print the predicted output (GPA).
6. **Print Coefficients**: Print the coefficient and y-intercept of the equation.
